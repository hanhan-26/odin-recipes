    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of
      coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream
      of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always
      requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to
      keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if
      desired. Feliz Navidad!
    </p>
